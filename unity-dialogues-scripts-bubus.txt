1) Kai was a reasonable person who was listened to so he put her life in perspective.
<color=blue>So I told her, "You are young. There will be other boys.  And someday, you will connect with somebody special, and the feeling will be mutual."</color>
<color=red>Sounds like good advice.  How did she take it?</color>
<color=blue>She buried her face in the pillow and sobbed. You remember how it was with your first love. It's the same with her.</color>
<color=red>I am so glad I am no longer a teen!</color>
<color=blue>Yeah, it is hard for teens to get a proper perspective on things at their age.</color>

<color=red>I have some balloons I've been practicing with, I managed to make a snake and a worm so far.</color>
<color=blue>Doesn't sound like you're making a whole lot of progress!</color>
