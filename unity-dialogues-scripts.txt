1) Kai was a reasonable person who was listened to so he put her life in perspective.
<color=red>So I told her, "You are young. There will be other boys.  And someday, you will connect with somebody special, and the feeling will be mutual."</color>
<color=blue>Sounds like good advice.  How did she take it?</color>
<color=red>She buried her face in the pillow and sobbed.  You remember how it was with your first love.  It seemed like the world was over when the relationship ended.  It's the same with her.</color>
<color=blue>I am so glad I am no longer a teen!</color>
<color=red>Yeah, it is hard for teens to get a proper perspective on things at their age.</color>
<color=blue>Good thing you were there for her and were able to give her some perspective.</color>


2) Ash got punched in the face and had to run home in terrible pain from this ordeal.
<color=red>I can't believe that guy punched me.</color>
<color=blue>It looks pretty bad.</color>
<color=red>It hurts terrible, I had to run home like this.</color>
<color=blue>You probably scared some people on your way.</color>
<color=red>My face hurts so bad.</color>
<color=blue>I bet, next time duck.</color>


3) Sydney met Carson's mother for the first time last week. He liked her.
<color=red>I met Carson's mother last week for the first time.</color>
<color=blue>How was she?</color>
<color=red>She turned out to be really nice. I like her.</color>
<color=blue>That's good to hear.</color>
<color=red>It is, especially since Carson and I are getting serious.</color>
<color=blue>Well, at least you'll like your in-law if you guys get married.</color>

4) Kendall had a party at Jordan's house but was found out to not have asked and just broke in.
<color=red>Did you hear about my party this weekend at Jordan's house?</color>
<color=blue>I heard it was amazing, but that you broke in.</color>
<color=red>That was a misunderstanding, I had permission to be there.</color>
<color=blue>Who gave you permission?</color>
<color=red>I talked to Jordan about it months ago before he left town to go to school, but he forgot to tell his roommates about it.</color>
<color=blue>Ok cool, I hope everything gets resolved.</color>

5) Austin left in a huff of rage after they were beaten in the video game competition.
<color=red>I got so mad, I couldn't contain it anymore.</color>
<color=blue>Did you huff off?</color>
<color=red>I did, I flared up into anger.</color>
<color=blue>You need to calm down, it's just a video game.</color>
<color=red>I know, I should not let it get to me like this.</color>
<color=blue>Blow off some steam and come back.</color>


6) Ash was off sick for 3 weeks so when they returned Aubrey provided Ash an overview of what had been happening.
<color=red>I had to fill Ash in with what happened in the last 3 weeks.</color>
<color=blue>Was Ash out or something?</color>
<color=red>He was off sick for 3 weeks.</color>
<color=blue>That is quite a long time to be off.</color>
<color=red>I got him caught up on what had been going on around here so we have nothing to worry about.</color>

7) Jesse was horrible at saving money, they nickled and dimed everything.
<color=red>Let's go to the casino.</color>
<color=blue>Don't you think we should save some money instead of gambling it all away?</color>
<color=red>I've never been good at saving, money is for spending.</color>
<color=blue>Ok. Let's go hit the slots.</color>
<color=red>I'm feeling lucky today, we might hit the jackpot.</color>
<color=blue>That would be great since last time we lost big.</color>

8) Riley and Sasha went hiking. Sasha was more experienced and went ahead before realizing it and stopping. Riley hurried to catch up to her height on the trail.
<color=red>I went hiking with Sasha yesterday.</color>
<color=blue>How did it go? I know she goes hiking a lot.</color>
<color=red>It was really hard. She stormed ahead without realising it and had to stop and wait for me.</color>
<color=blue>That's nice of her. How do you feel today?</color>
<color=red>I'm exhuasted.</color>

9) Carson went to visit the amazon rain forest 3 years ago and Jan finally heard back from carson.

<color=blue>Is he back in the city?</color>
<color=red>He told me he just got back and was reaching out to all of his friends.</color>
<color=blue>What did he do in the amazon forest?</color>

<color=blue>Wow, that's amazing!</color>

10) Riley had to work hard to fix her garden after a storm uprooted a tree onto her garden.
<color=red>That was a really bad storm!</color>
<color=blue>It was, the wind tore down trees all over the place.</color>
<color=red>One fell down and wrecked my garden.</color>
<color=blue>Oh no, are you going to fix it?</color>
<color=red>Yeah, it's going to be a ton of work.</color>
<color=blue>I hope it's not too bad.</color>

11) Jan was in art class for the first time. Jan will oil paint fruits and vases.
<color=red>I have always wanted to take an art class, and so I finally started taking one yesterday.</color>
<color=blue>Really? That's great! Do you like it so far?</color>
<color=red>Yes, I already love it. I think I'm going to make a good artist.</color>
<color=blue>What kinds of things are you painting yet?</color>
<color=red>Well we were using oil paints, and we painted stuff like fruit and vases.</color>
<color=blue>Fruits and vases? To me, that sounds super boring!</color>

12) Austin went to the first baseball game of the season. Austin enjoyed the game.
<color=red>I had so much fun at the game. Its nice to see baseball come back.</color>
<color=blue>I know but the social distancing at the beer tent was crazy.</color>
<color=red>I know but I love these New York Yankees masks they were giving away.</color>
<color=blue>I did not like that we could not keep the foul balls due to potential contamination.</color>
<color=red>I loved the hot dogs and cracker jack. Missed baseball. Plus they won!</color>
<color=blue>I hated sitting six seats away from you. Felt like a lonely loser.</color>

13) Addison kept asking sydney for the directions until sydney got mad and refused to give the directions again.
<color=red>I think being forgetful is taking a toll on others.</color>
<color=blue>Did you annoy somebody?</color>
<color=red>I was going somewhere with Sydney and I kept asking for directions.</color>
<color=blue>Is that a big deal?</color>
<color=red>I guess so, Sydney got mad and wouldn't give me the directions anymore.</color>
<color=blue>Maybe you should get a GPS.</color>

14) Lee was practicing to be a clown. They really wanted to do balloon animals, so Lee got a balloon to practice with.
<color=red>Making balloon animals is harder than I thought it would be!</color>
<color=blue>Well, I'm sure being a clown overall isn't a walk in the park.</color>
<color=red>I have some balloons I've been practicing with, I managed to make a snake and a worm so far.</color>
<color=blue>Doesn't sound like you're making a whole lot of progress!</color>
<color=red>Give me time and I'll be able to make a dog, you wait and see.</color>
<color=blue>Yeah, a hot dog!</color>
       
15) Sasha only speaks Spanish. Quinn knows how to speak Spanish.
<color=red>I had a nice conversation with Sasha the other day.</color>

<color=red>She is, she's actually really pleasant, I liked her a lot.</color>
<color=blue>Wait, does she speak English?</color>
<color=red>No, she has yet to learn our language, we had a conversation in Spanish.</color>
<color=blue>I didn't know you spoke Spanish.</color>

<color=blue>Is he well?</color>
<color=red>Yeah, he keeps asking me why the family won't come.</color>
<color=blue>Oh that's sad, I hope you explained to him what was going on.</color>
<color=red>I did, and he cried, I feel bad for him.</color>
<color=blue>Me too.</color>

17) Carson takes the children to the beach. When Carson isn't looking the child buries Carson's keys in the sand.
<color=red>My kids buried my keys in the sand today.</color>
<color=blue>In their sandbox in the backyard?</color>
<color=red>No we had a family day at the beach. It took hours to find the keys.</color>
<color=blue>They didn't know where they buried them?</color>
<color=red>They didn't, so we had to just go over all the spots where they were.</color>
<color=blue>Well at least you did find them.</color>

18) Sydney needed a new car, so the hunkered down and saved money for a down payment.
<color=red>I needed a new car, so what did I do?</color>
<color=blue>I don't know, steal one?</color>
<color=red>Very funny, I worked hard and saved money for a down payment.</color>
<color=blue>What a novel idea.</color>
<color=red>O.K, wise guy; I don't see you with a new car.</color>
<color=blue>You've got me there.</color>

19) Bailey made Jan's mom a scarf. It was a thoughtful and original gift.
<color=red>Jan's mom was so touched by my gift. I'm so happy.</color>
<color=blue>That's great. I thought the scarf turned out really great.</color>
<color=red>Thanks. It sure took a lot of time. But it was worth it.</color>
<color=blue>A homemade present always has a special extra feel to it.</color>
<color=red>I think so, too. That's why I love doing it.</color>
<color=blue>Well, I wouldn't mind something like that for my birthday. Just saying.</color>

20) Lee told Ash to follow the trail from the house towards the cabin in the woods.
<color=red>I wonder if Ash got to the cabin safely. I gave her directions.</color>
<color=blue>You let her go into the woods by herself?</color>
<color=red>I was at work. I told her I'd go with her afterwards but she didn't want to wait.</color>
<color=blue>What direction was she going?</color>
<color=red>I told her to just follow the trail to the cabin.</color>
